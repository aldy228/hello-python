This is Aldiyar Nurbekov’s repository for the PP2 course at KBTU.
It contains clean, well‑commented Python examples and explanations for all core topics needed to understand and master Python, including:
    Basic syntax, variables, input/output, and data types (numbers, strings, booleans, lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries)
    Operators, control flow (if/elif/else, loops), and logical expressions
    Functions, arguments, *args and **kwargs, lambda expressions, and scope
    Classes, objects, inheritance, method overriding, and class/instance variables
The goal of this repository is to serve as a structured, easy‑to‑read reference and practice resource for PP2 students who want to build solid Python fundamentals and prepare confidently for labs, assignments, and exams.
